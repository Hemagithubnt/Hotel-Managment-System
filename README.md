# Hotel-Managment-System
A Hotel Management System (HMS) is software that automates hotel operations like room reservations, guest management, billing, and staff coordination. It includes key features such as online booking, check-in/check-out management, room status tracking, and automated invoicing. The system improves efficiency by integrating payment gateways, generating reports, and handling housekeeping schedules. It can be built using Python (Django), Java (Spring Boot), or Node.js, with databases like MySQL or MongoDB. Advanced features may include AI chatbots, IoT for smart rooms, and mobile app integration. The HMS ensures smooth hotel operations, enhances the guest experience, and boosts overall revenue.
